A simple portal website for you minecraft server.

So, if you're wanting to use this template for your website, you'll need a webserver/hosting.

You're not allowed to 'steal' this template and post it ANYWHERE else.
The offical links for this template are:

And for the live demo:

That's basically it for now.

Good luck with setting up your website!
